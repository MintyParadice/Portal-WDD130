                    How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?
                    When I was planning my request for my site, I though it would be cool if it a was site for my online pressence, and the images where just things I liked and couldn't draw in time for the final product.
                    How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?
                    We Communicated through email
                    Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?
                    Honestly, it's not what I imagined, but it still looks great, the project page is exactly how I wanted it, but the music page wasn't.
                    What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?
                    Next time, I will have more specific instructions, and provide images far eariler than I did here. As well as communicate with em more directly.

                <div class="hero-text">
                    How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?
                    We communicated in person, and I told em which page to work on.
                    How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?
                    I communicated with em through email, and in person.
                    How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?
                    I shared it with em via email, and in Github. which wasn't smart.
                    How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?
                    I didn't enjoy also being a junior dev for another site since my time was so focused on multiple things.

                    How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?
                    Only one of my teamleads, talked with me and helped me choose which part of the site I'd work on.
                    Did you know what was expected of you for each site?
                    Yes, as far as I was aware it was to make it look like requested and thats it.
                    Were you able to contribute to your sites?
                    Only one, but barely since, I also had a teamlead job to do. Also the second Leaddev, didn't even contact me.
                    Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?
                    None.

                    What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?
                    Having multiple sites, and Real life interfering with the task.
                    What did you enjoy most about this project?
                    I think creating the outline for my own site, and seeing the progress daily.
                    What would you do differently if you could do the project again?
                    I think, I would have each task only be a week, so we be Lead Dev, and Junior Dev per week. instead of all at once.
                    Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.
                    I think I do, as long as I don't have to deal with school, and other projects while trying to focus on one.
